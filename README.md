# another_calc_for_bash
Sometimes i need to calculate smthing in terminal and i dont wanna install another calc from official repo, i want to create it!
# First of all i need to answer the question "Which operation do you include in your calculator?"
I guess it would be: sum, sub, multi, division, %(i dont remember how it cals) with integer(mb up to 42kkk, it long long in c++) and double.
\nYe, i know that its simple, i just wanna to create simple programm for my useful. :/
